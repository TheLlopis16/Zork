# Zork

Tiny text adventure in C++17. The game UI and commands are in English; this README explains everything you can do.

üó∫Ô∏è World map

Hall (start)
west ‚áÑ Living Room
east ‚áÑ Hallway

Living Room: a key lies on the table.

Hallway
north ‚áÑ Room 1 (locked; first time requires the key, then it stays unlocked forever)
south ‚áÑ Room 2

Room 1: a bagpack (a simple container you can put items into, but not take out).

Room 2: ball, teddy, car (pickable).

When you move, only the room name is printed. The description is shown by look.

üéÆ Commands

help/h	                Show this help summary.
go <dir>	              Move: north/south/east/west or n/s/e/w.
look	                  Describe the current room (text, exits, visible items).
look <item>	            Describe an item. If it‚Äôs the bagpack, list its contents (or show ‚ÄúThe bagpack is empty‚Äù).
inventory / inv / i	    Show your inventory (max 5 items). If you carry a bagpack with items inside, prints a second line listing them.
take <item>	            Pick up an item from the room (if there‚Äôs space in your inventory).
place <item>	          Put an item from your inventory into your bagpack. Items placed in the bagpack cannot be retrieved.
drop <item>	            Drop an item and it vanishes. Dropping the bagpack makes it disappear with all its contents.
quit	                  Exit the game.

Notes

Item names and directions are case-insensitive (Key = key).
Items inside the bagpack don‚Äôt count toward the 5-slot inventory (because place removes them from your inventory).
The Hallway ‚Üí Room 1 door needs the key the first time; once opened, that exit is permanently unlocked.

üß† Rules & behavior

Movement: entering a room prints only [Room Name].
look (room): prints description, exits, and visible items.

look <item>:
If the item is in your inventory or in the room: prints its description.
If it‚Äôs the bagpack: shows its contents or ‚ÄúThe bagpack is empty‚Äù.

Inventory: up to 5 items.

Bagpack:
Simple container: you can place items into it, but cannot take them out.
You must carry the bagpack to use place.
drop bagpack deletes the bagpack and everything inside.

Key:
Found in Living Room.
Unlocks north exit in Hallway to Room 1.
After the first successful entry, the door remains unlocked forever.
